They cannot touch or converse during these awkward times, yet somehow immediately acquire a strong attraction for each other.  They desperately search for ways to communicate, but can only feel each others' auras and as fate would have it, fall madly in love. Several people around the world are equally afflicted.  Mysteries unfold, as the reader becomes helplessly attached to the favorite characters.</p>

        <p class="he1"><strong>THE EARLY YEARS - BOOK 1</strong></p>
        <p class="he2"><strong>by PAM BONDY</strong></p>
        <p class="bod">Jim's life has been cursed with an overabundance of amazing mishaps and near-death experiences.</p>
        <p class="bod">This compilation details the extraordinary casualties and bad luck incidents that befell him during his first fourteen years of life.  The stories are all true, yet you may experience an overwhelming temtation to question the validity of a few of them.  I can attest to the fact that every calamity had witness' back in their day, but many have passed on to a greener pasture.  The several hospital visits that tended to Jim's maladies, were all documented somewhere back in the 1950s and 60s.  Of course, Jim has endured the common accidents that most other kids have suffered, but you won't find the mundane here. </p>
        <p class="bod">A unique collection of short stories will drag you along with Jim on a painful journey; one which you will not soon forget.</p>
        <p class="bod">You'll be flattened, beaten, poisoned, and attacked by vicious dogs. A DC3 plane will have it out for you.  You'll wish that the ordeal with the half-ton hog was over.  Death's door will display you dangling above it, but not before the building has its' fun.  Don't despair though. You think you're having a run of bad luck, but if you survive it all, as did your accomplice Jim, actually you're enjoying a stroke of good fortune. </p>
        <p class="bod">Jim has come to the conclusion that Mother Nature, in her bored moments, looks for ways to entertain herself.  As fate would have it, he has become one of her most cherished targets.  He has somehow survived and is now willing to tell all.  The boy has consistently been one step ahead of the Grim Reaper, yet ever under the mischievous thumb of Mother Nature.  All of the stories are unique, yet true and will hold your interest.  When you set down the book to go about your life, your mind will wander to Jim and try to guess what he might be up to next.</p>
        <p class="bod">The most amazing part is that he still lives today, (well, when I wrote his memoirs anyway), and is always eager to share his multitude of adventurous accounts, with anyone who is willing to listen.</p>
        <p class="bod">Now read on so you can recommend these stories of "The Earlky Years" to friends. The first book of the trilogy, "Things That Should Have Killed Me"</p>
        <p class="b1">Flattened by a car</p>
        <p class="b1">Fight to the death</p>
        <p class="b1">Haunted DC3 plane</p>
        <p class="b1">19 short stories = 19 calamities</p>

          <p class="bod">The pandemic didn't start with Samantha, but reluctantly she certainly was the first to go public.  World-wide, the people were starving and suffering tremendous pain whenever thay ate, but little was being done by the professionals. Misdiagnoses' were running rampant and eventually everyone was forced to suffer in silence, or undergo the unwanted consequences.</p>
          <p class="bod">Grudgingly, Samantha spoke to individuals that also needed help and this started her personal domino effect, which led to a friend having meetings, an eavesdropping customer reaching out to insane asylums and prisons, and eventually an extremely embarrassing situation that lead to a radio station willing to listen.</p>
          <p class="bod">Samantha was very much alone with the plague.  She stumbles on another person that is secretly in pain and begins to compare notes.  Then when she gets a job in a bakery she finds the ouwner is also silently suffering.  She informs the bakery owner that there are others like her.  When the owner starts having meetings at her house regarding her illness, the cat is out of the bag, so to speak.  At this point Samantha has an idea on how to help everyone.</p>

          <p class="b1">Why is the reporter involved?</p>
          <p class="b1">Will Samantha survive?</p>

      <p class="he1"><strong>MOM'S WONDERFUL MEMORIES</strong></p>
      <p class="he2"><strong>by PAM BONDY</strong></p>
         <br>
         <p class="bod">This work of art is flooded with true stories about Kimberly from conception to the age of twenty-three.  It is written with the momories of a mother as she tells her daughter stories of her past.  She doesn't want her childhood memories to disappear with time as hers has and this is her only way of keeping it all alive.  I hope this book will make you laugh, cause you to tear-up and allow you to feel good as you relive Kimberly's life.</p>
         <p class="bod">The last four stories are two memorable stories from dad's childhood and two memorable stories from mom's childhood.  The parents stuck these in to remind Kimberly that her parents were also young once.  They also added these stories in case Kimgerly was a little embarrassed about the way her mother remembered her growing years.  It's a little bit of their own embarrassment.  Each has offered a first memory and a memory that has stood out and remained dear to their hearts.</p>
         <p class="bod">After you enjoy this book enought that you wish you could continue with her life, I recommend that you read Kimberly's little brother's book, 'Jeffery'.  Some shared stories of the both of them will repeat themselves but though Jefferyu's life is just as impressive, you will hear more about Kimberly in situations shere she is not the main player.</p>
