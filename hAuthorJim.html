        <p class="b1">Born in 1949, Windsor Ontario Canada, this author was raised in the west end by hardworking, loving parents.  His extraordinary social life was markedly changed for the better, when he married his loving companion Pamela at age 24.  Together they raised two wonderful children.</p>
        <p class="b1">Jim was possessed with an incessant desire to hike, perhaps due to his father's inability to do so thanks to a debilitating bout with Muscular Dystrophy. The author fulfilled it through a multitude of backpacking adventures, all the while accompanied by his young adult children.</p>
        <p class="b1">Jim toiled hard in construction, then went on to work in  the factories.  His final act, as such, lead him to the profession of health and safety environmental coordinator, for a tier-one multinational automotive supply company.  Jim retired  at the healthy age of 68.</p>
        <p class="b1">Throughout these remarkable years, his love of writing prevailed.  You are about to enjoy reading one of his stories.</p>

   </div>

          <href=""></href></a>
        <p class="b1">This epic fantasy novel is based on a true tale that hasn’t quite happened yet.  Well, my mention that it has not happened yet, does not tell the full truth, as we all have no desire to admit what’s in store for our children, not to mention our children's children.  Rest assured you will find parodies throughout, equal to yesterday and today's bizarre events with only slight embellishments, some of which,  being quite outrageous.  It’s just the nature of such things.  You may notice that my unique manner of script is quite intriguing indeed, due to my penchant for animating inanimate objects.  In its’ curious nature, which I feel exudes excitement, the mundane is enabled to feel very much alive.</p>
        <p class="b1">Since, as I’ve mentioned, it is based on a true story which is not exactly true, I must attest to the fact that this is a fictitious piece, which I’m certain you will enjoy, providing that fantastical creatures happen to be the magical tea, which happily dives into your morning cup.</p>
        <p class="b1">I sincerely apologize for the omission of foul language.  Yeah no swearing here, but I am quite aware that some of you require this necessary addition since some authors possess the inability to articulate in its’ darn absence...See?  I’ll assume you’re acceptance of my apology since I haven’t lost you yet.</p>
        <p class="b1">Hopefully, racism isn’t part of your resume, as we have mentions of Humans, Groffins, and Perths...all of which do not resemble each other, as such, being physical anomalies from unique dimensions of their own.  Their speech differences are nonexistent, but the cut of their looks and the color and texture of their skin...well... not so much.  So sorry to see you go. The Perth hates the Groffins with a great degree of passion, just because they are Groffins.  I really don’t get it though; doesn't make any sense but that's just the way some were taught. This form of hate doesn't come naturally.</p>
        <p class="b1">If during your journey with this piece, you feel that I’ve articulated to some degree in error, please re-read the passage and think about the words...look deeper.  Open your thoughts to the architecture of the wording.  A message may be glaring at you.  Every sentence has been engineered and puzzled to fit together, perhaps, at times, circumvented to produce an effect.  Relax, and just let go</p>
        <p class="b1">I trust that your enjoyment while reading my novel, matches the pleasure I experienced as I brought it to life.</p>
        <p class="b2">Your Author, Jim Bondy
        <p class="b3">My Job? To free you from reality.
        <p class="b4">Just for a while.
