        <p class="b1"> PAM BONDY was born the fifth of seven children in LaSalle, Ontario in the mid 1950s to a farmer/mechanic and his wife.  Pam had a simple uncomplicated life and spent most of her growing years in Windsor Ontario Canada.  She knew the moment she met Jim, at the age of eighteen, that he was the love of her life.</p>
        <p class="b1">They married in November of 1974 and have a delightful daughter and son to brag about.  Pam has the added pleasure of four terrific grandsons and one great-grandson so far (at the time of this writing), who all tug at her heart.</p>
        <p class="b1">Pam’s enjoyable down-to-earth existence has followed her for many years.  Storytelling has always been pleasurable and her life became complete when she discovered, (in her mid-50s) that the penchant for writing was her super-power.  In the middle of her first book, there were two others that wouldn’t allow themselves to be pushed aside.  She has been producing great works ever since.</p>

        <p class="b1">For centuries, Mother Nature has tolerated the human race.  Since the day we evolved into human form, we have tried to change the earth to suit us.  She’s expanded our brains in the hope that we would learn to live with all she has supplied for us.  But we only destroy parts of her in our desperate attempts to understand.</p>
        <p class="b1">All other animals work with Mother Nature, but humans are never satisfied. </p>
        <p class="b1">During a storm, animals will huddle under bushes, inside caves, or stand on the wayside as they nestle in close to an obstacle to block the winds, and wait patiently for the worst to pass.</p>
        <p class="b1">Humans will cut down trees to build a shelter, destroying a little piece of ‘Mother’.</p>
        <p class="b1">In times of threat and danger, animals will flee, tuck, fight, hide or burrow, until it is once again safe to continue on their peaceful way.</p>
        <p class="b1">Humans will cut branches for arrows and spears, dig up metals to make swords and guns, and eventually invent bombs to prevent backing down from their enemies. This continues to destroy pieces of ‘Mother’.</p>
        <p class="b1">Animals go to the river to drink and the forest for protection and food.</p>
        <p class="b1">Humans reroute the rivers to bring the water to them and move the forest closer or farther for their convenience.  ‘Mother could adjust to this, if only there weren’t so many of us, everywhere, taking clear advantage of her, as we continue destroying and hurting vital parts of her.</p>
        <p class="b1">Animals will have large litters of young, several times a year, and still stay within their allowed population.  Mother Nature limits humans to about one child per year and still we managed to overpopulate the planet, stacking people one on top of the other in gargantuan cities.  Again, we are damaging ‘Mother’.</p>
        <p class="b1">‘Mother’ has sent us plagues, famine, killer weather, volcanoes, and earthquakes in her attempt to get us under control.  We have always won the battle by destroying her a little farther with our attempts to survive these disasters.  It’s only a matter of time before Mother Nature is gone and we all point our greedy little fingers at everyone and everything ELSE as we look for blame.  ‘Mother’ is now slapping us with global warming and what are we doing about it?  Everything is wrong and nothing right, as only humans do best.  No matter what advances in automation and industrialization that we accomplish, ‘Mother’ will surely suffer the consequences.</p>
        <p class="b1">‘Mother’ is tired.  If she can’t get the human race to obey her rules, she’ll have to try a new strategy.  She will give us more power than ever before; finally able to see that power is the thing that humans cherish most.  If she can get each individual to specialize in one precise task, then she won’t have to listen to the multitude, as they pretend to figure out how to save Mother Nature, while they continue to destroy her in so many different ways.</p>
        <p class="b1">Go after and control the strongest creatures on the planet and you have your dominance.  ‘Mother’ must go after us before it’s too late.</p>
        <p class="b1">She will give everyone more power.  Each individual will have a power unique to their own situation.  Communication from a young age is important to the very young, while medical service is important to the very sick.  Give a woman better eyesight to see into places where she can make improvements while supplying acute hearing to a man, who would surely be willing to hear the truth.</p>
        <p class="b1">Let someone solve the pollution of our lakes and oceans, while his brother eradicates air impurities caused by the factories' billowing smokestacks.  His sister might attack serious noise issues, created by the billions of mechanical devices.  ‘Mother’ is desperate for power herself and alone she cannot win against the human plague, so make the human race think on her level.  Get them to slow down and do it right the first time, as ‘Mother’ has learned to do.  Enjoy the wonders of your world.</p>
        <p class="b1">DOING WHAT’S BEST FOR EVERYONE AND NOT JUST WHAT’S BEST FOR ME.  ‘Mother’ has learned this lesson from the beginning of time.  Now it’s our turn.</p>
        <p class="b1">The human race is about to change.  Each individual must develop their special gift from Mother Nature, so we can finally learn to live together in peace.  Developing it, understanding it, and deciding to live with it is the hardest thing to do.  Once it is accepted and welcomed into our hearts; only then can we stop hurting ‘Mother’.</p>
        <p class="b1">When humans admit to the importance of recognizing their new ability, war, hate and the fight for power will become obsolete.  The evils of mankind will dwindle away and world peace will become possible; as the few characters in this book will show you.</p>
