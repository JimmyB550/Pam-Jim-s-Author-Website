        <p class="b1">My job?  To free you from reality</p>
        <p class="b1">Just for a while</p>
        <p class="bod">We knew nothing of the portal leading to the world of Groffins and Perths, who dwelled in this mysterious dimension where no soul had even dared to enter…not that one, shy of extraordinary powers, ever could.</p>
        <p class="bod">I had launched a family hiking adventure, trekking on one of the most obscure backpacking trails in the world.  To our dismay, destiny quickly transposed normalcy into an arcane reality as we risked our lives venturing through this gateway.</p>
        <p class="bod">Can you help Flowah and Mafren avert the untimely rebellion created by their nemesis, the Perth? The magical adventures that we faced with the telepathic creatures, who had lured us into their 'Home World' set the stage; a land where time, physics, and logic didn't play by our rules…not even close.</p>
        <p class="bod">Find yourself rowing a dory through the infested swamp to the old salt, Mister Brunar's hovel.'Ye moight wont ta stai fer a nip'.</p>
        <p class="bod">Scramble about in desperation through the feculent sewers of the bankrupt metropolis, to escape certain death at the hands of your would-be captors, all the while invading the privacy of the inquisitive rodents.  During your maddening quest for mere survival, you less than half expect to make it.  Your pact with the devil is sealed, so it would seem.</p>
        <p class="b1">Will we survive the trek through the walsung-infested tunnel?</p>
        <p class="b1">Is Flowah's attack a sign of things to come?</p>
        <p class="b1">Why are the Perths murdering the lowly Groffins?</p>
        <p class="b1">How will Alandos survive the berating and beatings from Beggan?</p>
        <p class="b1">Will we arrive in time?  Beggan has run totally out of control.</p>
        <p class="b1">Will Tang's leadership of the Groffins endure? </p>
        <p class="b1">Can Wolfan's values ever be accepted by his nemesis?</p>
        <p class="he3">You will find:</p>
          <p class="bod">Comradery with strong family strengths and values.<br>
          Humor interjected here and there.<br>
          Intrigue throughout between villains and kings.<br>
          Humans and Creatures alike with extraordinary abilities and powers.<br>
          Physics acting as you could not imagine.<br><br>
          ~~~~There is some violence though, so your discretion is advised~~~~<br>
          The High Fantasy Adventure is great for ALL AGES.
          </p>
        <p class="he3">You Will NOT Find:</p> 
          <p class="bod">There's NO SEX or sexual innuendo.<br>
          Language is CLEAN no swearing.<br>
          No taking God's name in vain.<br>
          </p>
        <p class="bod">So just cozy up in your favorite nook.<br>
          and let me free you from reality<br>
          ...Just for a while
